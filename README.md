# This app is working perfectly on full hd + resolutions! On mobile phone's it have some problem's. 

# Last bootcamp project, using framework React by Konrad Kedron

* I want to merge some kinds of applications to make just one app.
  It's very annoying to check every day 5/10 app's. For example every time when i wake up i have to open weather-app,
  fitness, notes, calendar, stock Exchange and my works alerts. I will solve it.

  ### So... this is the function's which I will apply:

1. Calendar.
2. Hourly alert's which you want to set.
3. Type's of alert's (e.g. work-alert, dinner-alert etc.).
4. Cryptocurrency counter. We can add exactly this which we want to see. (everything by external API).
5. Notes which types(important, private...), comments and buttons (some kind of TODO app.).
7. Weather from our city (another external API).


* And another we will see soon..

## To make it the best i will use:

* Sass - css framework on advanced lvl.
* React - javascript framework (React 18.0 with functional components and hooks)
* Git - git repository for full control versions of my project https://github.com/Konradk7
* Firebase - firebase servers.

## Soon:

* Rebuild by TypeScript
* Use Docker and Kubernates
* Use Node.js and express framework
* Add mobile app by React Native
* Make my own API for rendering app with languages which we will choose
